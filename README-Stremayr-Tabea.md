# CalculatorImpl.java

**Description**\
This program can make easy calculations with two numbers.
It implements ICalculator.
There is one special case, that the program deals with: When dividing two numbers and the result is either not a number or infinity (division by zero),\
it throws an exception. A self-written warning appears that the division with these two numbers is not possible.

**Requirements**\
If you want to read this program you need to know java and you have to install a suitable IDE for this language, for example IntelliJ.

**Usage**
```
CalculatorImpl calculator = new CalculatorImpl();

//returns 2
